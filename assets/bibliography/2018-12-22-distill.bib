  abstract = {Data-driven, or machine learning (ML), approaches have become viable alternatives to semiempirical methods to construct interatomic potentials, due to their capacity to accurately interpolate and extrapolate from first-principles simulations if the training database and descriptor representation of atomic structures are carefully chosen. Here, we present highly accurate interatomic potentials suitable for the study of dislocations, point defects, and their clusters in bcc iron and tungsten, constructed using a linear or quadratic input-output mapping from descriptor space. The proposed quadratic formulation, called quadratic noise ML, differs from previous approaches, being strongly preconditioned by the linear solution. The developed potentials are compared to a wide range of existing ML and semiempirical potentials, and are shown to have sufficient accuracy to distinguish changes in the exchange-correlation functional or pseudopotential in the underlying referenc data, while retaining excellent transferability. The flexibility of the underlying approach is able to target properties almost unattainable by traditional methods, such as the negative divacancy binding energy in W or the shape and the magnitude of the Peierls barrier of the 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation in both metals. We also show how the developed potentials can be used to target important observables that require large time-and-space scales unattainable with first-principles methods, though we emphasize the importance of thoughtful database design and degrees of nonlinearity of the descriptor space to achieve the appropriate passage of information to large-scale calculations. As a demonstration, we perform direct atomistic calculations of the relative stability of 1/2⟨111⟩ dislocations loops and three-dimensional C15 clusters in Fe and find the crossover between the formation energies of the two classes of interstitial defects occurs at around 40 self-interstitial atoms. We also compute the kink-pair formation energy of the 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation in Fe and W, finding good agreement with density functional theory informed line tension models that indirectly measure those quantities. Finally, we exploit the excellent finite-temperature properties to compute vacancy formation free energies with full anharmonicity in thermal vibrations. The presented potentials thus open up many avenues for systematic investigation of free-energy landscape of defects with ab initioaccuracy.}

Here, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations are employed to study the ⟨111⟩ screw dislocation glide in W in the presence of H, using the virtual work principle to obtain energy barriers for dislocation glide, H segregation, and pipe diffusion. We provide a convincing validation of the QM/MM approach against full DFT energy-based methods. This is possible because the compact core and relatively weak elastic fields of ⟨111⟩ screw dislocations allow them to be contained in periodic DFT supercells. We also show that H segregation stabilizes the split-core structure while leaving the Peierls barrier almost unchanged. Furthermore, we find an energy barrier of less than 0.05 eV for pipe diffusion of H along dislocation cores. Our quantum-accurate calculations provide important reference data for the construction of larger-scale material models.},

abstract = {Calculations of dislocation-defect interactions are essential to model metallic strength, but the required system sizes are at or beyond ab initio limits. Current estimates thus have extrapolation or finite size errors that are very challenging to quantify. Hybrid methods offer a solution, embedding small ab initio simulations in an empirical medium. However, current implementations can only match mild elastic deformations at the ab initio boundary. We describe a robust method to employ linear-in-descriptor machine learning potentials as a highly flexible embedding medium, precisely matching dislocation migration pathways whilst keeping at least the elastic properties constant. This advanced coupling allows dislocations to cross the ab initio boundary in fully three dimensional defect geometries. Investigating helium and vacancy segregation to edge and screw dislocations in tungsten, we find long-range relaxations qualitatively change impurity-induced core reconstructions compared to those in short periodic supercells, even when multiple helium atoms are present. We also show that helium-vacancy complexes, considered to be the dominant configuration at low temperatures, have only a very weak binding to screw dislocations. These results are discussed in the context of recent experimental and theoretical studies. More generally, our approach opens a vast range of mechanisms to ab initio investigation and provides new reference data to both validate and improve interatomic potentials.},

@generic{Unke2021,
   abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning (ML) in computational chemistry has enabled numerous advances previously out of reach due to the computational complexity of traditional electronic-structure methods. One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.},

The first boundary, a symmetric (310)[001] Σ5 tilt boundary, is also tractable using traditional QM calculations, and serves as a validation for the QM/MM method. The second boundary is a general, low-symmetry tilt boundary that is completely inaccessible to pure QM calculations. QM/MM results for both of these boundaries are used to evaluate the accuracy of empirical (EAM) potentials for the Al-Mg and Al-Pb alloy systems. Based on these results we develop a physical model for the segregation energy based on elastic interaction and bond breaking terms. Both MM calculations with the EAM potentials and the model work quantitatively well for describing Mg-GB interaction across a wide range of local environments. For Pb, MM performance is weaker and the model provides only qualitative insight, demonstrating the utility of a QM/MM approach.}

We outline an improved scheme for QM/MM coupling in metals which permits the QM treatment of a small region chosen from a large, arbitrary MM domain to calculate total system energy and relaxed geometry. In order to test our improved method, we compute solute–vacancy binding in bulk Al as well as the binding of Mg and Pb to a symmetric Σ5 grain boundary. Results are calculated with and without our improvement to the QM/MM scheme and compared to periodic QM results for the same systems. We find that our scheme accurately and efficiently reproduces periodic QM target values in these test systems and therefore can be expected to perform well using more general geometries.}

Program summary
Program Title: MAELAS CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/gxcdg3z7t6.1 Developer’s repository link: https://github.com/pnieves2019/MAELAS Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/0361425 Licensing provisions: BSD 3-clause Programming language: Python3 Nature of problem: To calculate anisotropic magnetostrictive coefficients and magnetoelastic constants in an automated way based on Density Functional Theory methods. Solution method: In the first stage, the unit cell is relaxed through a spin-polarized calculation without spin-orbit coupling. Next, after a crystal symmetry analysis, a set of deformed lattice and spin configurations are generated using the pymatgen library [1]. The energy of these states is calculated by the first-principles code VASP [3], including the spin-orbit coupling. The anisotropic magnetostrictive coefficients are derived from the fitting of these energies to a quadratic polynomial [2]. Finally, if the elastic tensor is provided [4], then the magnetoelastic constants are also calculated. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: This version supports the following crystal systems: Cubic (point groups 432, 4̄3m, m3̄m), Hexagonal (6mm, 622, 6̄2m, 6∕mmm), Trigonal (32, 3m, 3̄m), Tetragonal (4mm, 422, 4̄2m, 4∕mmm) and Orthorhombic (222, 2mm, mmm).
