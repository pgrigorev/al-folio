I am a Research Fellow working in the field of computational material science.
I am interested in application and development of simulation methods bringing different length and time scales.
Recently I have been working on incorporating methods of reproducible research, uncertainty quantification and machine learning in multiscale modelling approach.

###### **Short bio**

I am from Saint-Petersburg and obtained my master degree in Physics from [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/) in 2012.
The same year I enrolled in a Ph.D. program shared between [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) and [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english) within the framework of [Erasmus Mundus FUSION-DC](http://www.em-fusion-dc.org/).
However I spent most of my time at [Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK•CEN](https://www.sckcen.be/en) in Mol, Belgium working on my research project together with [Structural Materials expert group](https://science.sckcen.be/en/Institutes/NMS/SMA).
I defended my Ph.D. in April 2017 and, shortly after that, joined [Warwick Centre for Predictive Modelling](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wcpm/) as a Research Fellow.

You can find my publications with all the details and some pdf versions on the [publications page](/publications/).

I will also do my best to post here news and updates often.
