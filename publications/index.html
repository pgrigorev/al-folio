Forward propagation of parameter variation is key for uncertainty quantification, whilst backpropagation has found application for emerging inverse problems such as fine-tuning or targeted design. Here, the implicit derivative of functions defined as a fixed point is used to Taylor-expand the energy and structure of atomic minima in potential parameters, evaluating terms via automatic differentiation, dense linear algebra or a sparse operator approach. The latter allows efficient forward and backpropagation through relaxed structures of arbitrarily large systems. The implicit expansion accurately predicts lattice distortion and defect formation energies and volumes with classical and machine-learning potentials, enabling high-dimensional uncertainty propagation without prohibitive overhead. We then show how the implicit derivative can be used to solve challenging inverse problems, minimizing an implicit loss to fine-tune potentials and stabilize solute-induced structural rearrangements at dislocations in tungsten.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Starikov2024_diffusion" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Large-scale atomistic simulation of diffusion in refractory metals and alloys</div> <div class="author"> <a href="https://www.icams.de/institute/icams/members/members-detail/?detail=1652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sergei Starikov</a>, <em>Petr Grigorev</em>, Ralf Drautz, and Sergiy V Divinski</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Phys.

The most productive technique has been large-scale atomistic simulation in the form of a numerical experiment in which a crystal with free surfaces was simulated for a relatively long time. This method is based on the concept that the free surface acts as a source of point defects and provides a natural way to achieve an equilibrium concentration of the defects within the bulk after an initial annealing stage. For complex concentrated alloys (CCAs), this numerical experiment offers the possibility to study diffusion processes where standard analytical approaches are difficult to apply due to the large variety of microscopic states.

Results showed similarities between the recorded load-displacement curves and dislocation densities, for different interatomic potentials and crystal orientations at low and room temperature. However, we observe concrete differences in the early stages of elastic-to-plastic deformation transition, revealing different mechanisms for dislocation nucleation and dynamics during loading, especially at higher temperatures.

Current estimates thus have extrapolation or finite size errors that are very challenging to quantify. Hybrid methods offer a solution, embedding small ab initio simulations in an empirical medium. However, current implementations can only match mild elastic deformations at the ab initio boundary. We describe a robust method to employ linear-in-descriptor machine learning potentials as a highly flexible embedding medium, precisely matching dislocation migration pathways whilst keeping at least the elastic properties constant. This advanced coupling allows dislocations to cross the ab initio boundary in fully three dimensional defect geometries. Investigating helium and vacancy segregation to edge and screw dislocations in tungsten, we find long-range relaxations qualitatively change impurity-induced core reconstructions compared to those in short periodic supercells, even when multiple helium atoms are present. We also show that helium-vacancy complexes, considered to be the dominant configuration at low temperatures, have only a very weak binding to screw dislocations. These results are discussed in the context of recent experimental and theoretical studies. More generally, our approach opens a vast range of mechanisms to ab initio investigation and provides new reference data to both validate and improve interatomic potentials.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 preview"><img class="preview z-depth-1 rounded" src="/assets/img/publication_preview/acs_nano_Mn2Au.png"></div> <div id="ACSNano_2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Optically Triggered Néel Vector Manipulation of a Metallic Antiferromagnet Mn2Au under Strain</div> <div class="author"> Vladimir Grigorev, Mariia Filianina, Yaryna Lytvynenko, Sergei Sobolev, Amrit Raj Pokharel, Amon P.

Here, we demonstrate manipulation of the Néel vector in the metallic collinear antiferromagnet Mn2Au by combining strain and femtosecond laser excitation. Applying tensile strain along either of the two in-plane easy axes and locally exciting the sample by a train of femtosecond pulses, we align the Néel vector along the direction controlled by the applied strain. The dependence on the laser fluence and strain suggests the alignment is a result of optically triggered depinning of 90° domain walls and their motion in the direction of the free energy gradient, governed by the magneto-elastic coupling. The resulting, switchable state is stable at room temperature and insensitive to magnetic fields. Such an approach may provide ways to realize robust high-density memory device with switching time scales in the picosecond range. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2021</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge"><a href="https://journals.aps.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhysRev</a></abbr></div> <div id="PhysRevMaterials.5.103803" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Efficient and transferable machine learning potentials for the simulation of crystal defects in bcc Fe and W</div> <div class="author"> Alexandra M.

Here, we present highly accurate interatomic potentials suitable for the study of dislocations, point defects, and their clusters in bcc iron and tungsten, constructed using a linear or quadratic input-output mapping from descriptor space. The proposed quadratic formulation, called quadratic noise ML, differs from previous approaches, being strongly preconditioned by the linear solution. The developed potentials are compared to a wide range of existing ML and semiempirical potentials, and are shown to have sufficient accuracy to distinguish changes in the exchange-correlation functional or pseudopotential in the underlying referenc data, while retaining excellent transferability. The flexibility of the underlying approach is able to target properties almost unattainable by traditional methods, such as the negative divacancy binding energy in W or the shape and the magnitude of the Peierls barrier of the 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation in both metals. We also show how the developed potentials can be used to target important observables that require large time-and-space scales unattainable with first-principles methods, though we emphasize the importance of thoughtful database design and degrees of nonlinearity of the descriptor space to achieve the appropriate passage of information to large-scale calculations. As a demonstration, we perform direct atomistic calculations of the relative stability of 1/2⟨111⟩ dislocations loops and three-dimensional C15 clusters in Fe and find the crossover between the formation energies of the two classes of interstitial defects occurs at around 40 self-interstitial atoms. We also compute the kink-pair formation energy of the 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation in Fe and W, finding good agreement with density functional theory informed line tension models that indirectly measure those quantities. Finally, we exploit the excellent finite-temperature properties to compute vacancy formation free energies with full anharmonicity in thermal vibrations. The presented potentials thus open up many avenues for systematic investigation of free-energy landscape of defects with ab initioaccuracy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2020</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge"><a href="https://journals.aps.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PhysRev</a></abbr></div> <div id="QMMM_H_SD" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Hybrid quantum/classical study of hydrogen-decorated screw dislocations in tungsten: Ultrafast pipe diffusion, core reconstruction, and effects on glide mechanism</div> <div class="author"> <em>Petr Grigorev</em>, <a href="https://tomswinburne.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomas D.

We provide a convincing validation of the QM/MM approach against full DFT energy-based methods. This is possible because the compact core and relatively weak elastic fields of ⟨111⟩ screw dislocations allow them to be contained in periodic DFT supercells. We also show that H segregation stabilizes the split-core structure while leaving the Peierls barrier almost unchanged.

Interaction of plasma components with the material leads to degradation of the performance and thus the lifetime of the in-vessel components. On top of that special attention is drawn to tritium retention in the reactors vessel from a safety point of view, since tritium is radioactive material. In order to gain better understanding of the mechanisms driving accumulation of plasma components in the material and subsequent degradation of the material, atomistic simulations are employed. The focus of this work is on so-called self trapping of H and He atoms or, in other words, Frenkel pair formation in bulk tungsten in the presence of H and He atoms. Two versions of a model embedded atom interatomic potential and a bond order potential were tested by comparing it with ab initio data regarding the binding properties of pure He and He-H-Vacancy clusters and energetics of Frenkel pair formation. As a result of Molecular Dynamics simulations at finite temperature, the values of critical H concentration needed for the generation of a Frenkel pair in the presence of He clusters were obtained. The results show that the critical H concentration decreases with the size of He cluster present in the simulation cell and thus, Frenkel pair formation by H is facilitated in the presence of He clusters in the material.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2017</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge">PhD Thesis</abbr></div> <div id="8519937" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessment of retention of plasma components in tungsten under high flux plasma exposure: multi-scale modelling approach</div> <div class="author"> <em>Petr Grigorev</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>PhD Thesis</em> Ghent University, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture/Universidad Complutnese de Madrid, Facultad de Ciencias Fisicas (Apr 2017) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-8519937" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/PhD_Grigorev.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank"><i class="far fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"> </i> PDF </a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The results of my work described in this thesis are roughly divided in three parts.

The lowest energy atomic configurations are rationalized on the basis of the charge density distribution and elasticity theory considerations. The results obtained contribute to the rationalization of the thermal desorption spectroscopy analysis by attributing certain peaks of the release of plasma components to the detrapping from dislocations. Complementary molecular statics (MS) calculations are performed to validate the accuracy of the recently developed W–H–He embedded atom method (EAM) and bond-order potentials. It is revealed that the EAM potential can reproduce correctly the magnitude of the interaction of H with both dislocations as compared to the ab initio results. All the potentials underestimate significantly the He-dislocation interaction and cannot describe correctly the lowest energy positions for H and He around the dislocation core.

A recently developed interatomic potential was benchmarked using data for dislocation loops obtained earlier with two other W potentials available in literature. Molecular Static calculations demonstrated that ½〈111〉 loops feature a wide spectrum of the binding energy with a maximum value of 1.1 eV for H and 1.93 eV for He as compared to 0.89 eV and 1.56 eV for a straight ½〈111〉110 edge dislocation. For 〈100〉 loops, the values of the binding energy were found to be 1.63 eV and 2.87 eV for H and He, respectively.

An important safety concern in the design of plasma facing components is the retention of hydrogen isotopes. Available experimental data is vast and scattered, and a consistent physical model of retention of hydrogen isotopes in tungsten is still missing. In this work we propose a model of non-equilibrium hydrogen isotopes trapping under fusion relevant plasma exposure conditions. The model is coupled to a diffusion-trapping simulation tool and is used to interpret recent experiments involving high plasma flux exposures. From the computational analysis performed, it is concluded that high flux high temperature exposures (T = 1000 K, flux = 1024 D/m2/s and fluence of 1026 D/m2) result in generation of sub-surface damage and bulk diffusion, so that the retention is driven by both sub-surface plasma-induced defects (bubbles) and trapping at natural defects. On the basis of the non-equilibrium trapping model we have estimated the amount of H stored in the sub-surface region to be ∼10−5 at−1, while the bulk retention is about 4 × 10−7 at−1, calculated by assuming the sub-surface layer thickness of about 10 μm and adjusting the trap concentration to comply with the experimental results for the integral retention.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="BAKAEVA2016307" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Dislocation-mediated trapping of deuterium in tungsten under high-flux high-temperature exposures</div> <div class="author"> A.

The desorption spectra in both reference and plastically-deformed samples were deconvoluted into three contributions associated with the detrapping from dislocations, deuterium-vacancy clusters and pores. As the exposure temperature increases, the positions of the release peaks in the plastically-deformed material remain in the same temperature range but the peak amplitudes are altered as compared to the reference material. The desorption peak attributed to the release from pores (i.e. cavities and bubbles) was suppressed in the plastically deformed samples for the low-temperature exposures, but became dominant for exposures above 700 K. The observed strong modulation of the deuterium storage in “shallow” and “deep” traps, as well as the reduction of the integral retention above 700 K, suggest that the dislocation network changes its role from “trapping sites” to “diffusion channels” above a certain temperature.

In this work we study migration, stability and self-trapping properties of pure helium and mixed helium-hydrogen clusters in tungsten by means of molecular dynamics simulations. We test two versions of an embedded atom model interatomic potential by comparing it with ab initio data regarding the binding properties of He clusters. By analysing the trajectories of the clusters during molecular dynamics simulations at finite temperatures we obtain the diffusion parameters. The results show that the diffusivity of mixed clusters is significantly lower, than that of pure helium clusters.

Once the number of hydrogen atoms trapped on a dislocation segment exceeds eight, the emission of a jog occurs thereby converting a pure HN cluster into a HN+1-jog configuration. On the basis of these results a kinetic model was formulated to evaluate the conditions (i.e., range of temperature and flux exposure) for the transformation of pure H clusters into supercritical hydrogen–vacancy clusters attached to the dislocation line. In this work, a parametric study employing the kinetic nucleation model was performed to derive the hydrogen bubble formation energy function that offers the best agreement with available experimental results.

In an effort to better understand the mechanisms driving the materials’ degradation at the atomic level, large-scale atomistic simulations are performed to complement experimental investigations. At the core of such simulations lies the interatomic potential, on which all subsequent results hinge. In this work we review 19 central force many-body potentials and benchmark their performance against experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As basic features we consider the relative lattice stability, elastic constants and point-defect properties. In addition, we also investigate extended lattice defects, namely: free surfaces, symmetric tilt grain boundaries, the 1/2〈111〉110 and 1/2〈111〉112 stacking fault energy profiles and the 1/2〈111〉 screw dislocation core. We also provide the Peierls stress for the 1/2〈111〉 edge and screw dislocations as well as the glide path of the latter at zero Kelvin.

It is shown that the total sputtering yield is higher under the bombardment of nanoclusters with monatomic ions than in the case of the crystal plane surface mainly due to an increase in the contribution of the cluster component of the secondaryemission spectrum. In this case, in practice there is nonoccurrence of any correlation between the secondaryemission characteristics and the particleprojectile impact parameter. In the case of cluster bombardment, the cluster component of the spectrum of sputtered particles is dominant for large impact parameters (i.e., for glancing impact) and the sputtering yield and the probability of the ejection of large fragments (containing half of the initialnanocluster atoms or more) increase significantly (as compared with similar values obtained under bombardment with monatomic particles). It is established that the main mechanism for the emission of large fragments is the cocalled “recoil effect”, where the impinging particle projectile causes the secondary emission of nanocluster target atoms predominantly toward the substrate; as a result, the clustertarget acquires momentum in the opposite direction. It is shown that this “recoil effect” can lead to the desorption of the nanocluster, deposited onto a plane Si(111) substrate.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Petr Grigorev.
