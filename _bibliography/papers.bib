abstract = { The absence of stray fields, their insensitivity to external magnetic fields, and ultrafast dynamics make antiferromagnets promising candidates for active elements in spintronic devices. Here, we demonstrate manipulation of the Néel vector in the metallic collinear antiferromagnet Mn2Au by combining strain and femtosecond laser excitation. Applying tensile strain along either of the two in-plane easy axes and locally exciting the sample by a train of femtosecond pulses, we align the Néel vector along the direction controlled by the applied strain. The dependence on the laser fluence and strain suggests the alignment is a result of optically triggered depinning of 90° domain walls and their motion in the direction of the free energy gradient, governed by the magneto-elastic coupling. The resulting, switchable state is stable at room temperature and insensitive to magnetic fields. Such an approach may provide ways to realize robust high-density memory device with switching time scales in the picosecond range. },

  abstract = {Data-driven, or machine learning (ML), approaches have become viable alternatives to semiempirical methods to construct interatomic potentials, due to their capacity to accurately interpolate and extrapolate from first-principles simulations if the training database and descriptor representation of atomic structures are carefully chosen. Here, we present highly accurate interatomic potentials suitable for the study of dislocations, point defects, and their clusters in bcc iron and tungsten, constructed using a linear or quadratic input-output mapping from descriptor space. The proposed quadratic formulation, called quadratic noise ML, differs from previous approaches, being strongly preconditioned by the linear solution. The developed potentials are compared to a wide range of existing ML and semiempirical potentials, and are shown to have sufficient accuracy to distinguish changes in the exchange-correlation functional or pseudopotential in the underlying referenc data, while retaining excellent transferability. The flexibility of the underlying approach is able to target properties almost unattainable by traditional methods, such as the negative divacancy binding energy in W or the shape and the magnitude of the Peierls barrier of the 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation in both metals. We also show how the developed potentials can be used to target important observables that require large time-and-space scales unattainable with first-principles methods, though we emphasize the importance of thoughtful database design and degrees of nonlinearity of the descriptor space to achieve the appropriate passage of information to large-scale calculations. As a demonstration, we perform direct atomistic calculations of the relative stability of 1/2⟨111⟩ dislocations loops and three-dimensional C15 clusters in Fe and find the crossover between the formation energies of the two classes of interstitial defects occurs at around 40 self-interstitial atoms. We also compute the kink-pair formation energy of the 1/2⟨111⟩ screw dislocation in Fe and W, finding good agreement with density functional theory informed line tension models that indirectly measure those quantities. Finally, we exploit the excellent finite-temperature properties to compute vacancy formation free energies with full anharmonicity in thermal vibrations. The presented potentials thus open up many avenues for systematic investigation of free-energy landscape of defects with ab initioaccuracy.}

Here, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations are employed to study the ⟨111⟩ screw dislocation glide in W in the presence of H, using the virtual work principle to obtain energy barriers for dislocation glide, H segregation, and pipe diffusion. We provide a convincing validation of the QM/MM approach against full DFT energy-based methods. This is possible because the compact core and relatively weak elastic fields of ⟨111⟩ screw dislocations allow them to be contained in periodic DFT supercells. We also show that H segregation stabilizes the split-core structure while leaving the Peierls barrier almost unchanged. Furthermore, we find an energy barrier of less than 0.05 eV for pipe diffusion of H along dislocation cores. Our quantum-accurate calculations provide important reference data for the construction of larger-scale material models.},

Interaction of plasma components with the material leads to degradation of the performance and thus the lifetime of the in-vessel components. On top of that special attention is drawn to tritium retention in the reactors vessel from a safety point of view, since tritium is radioactive material. In order to gain better understanding of the mechanisms driving accumulation of plasma components in the material and subsequent degradation of the material, atomistic simulations are employed. The focus of this work is on so-called self trapping of H and He atoms or, in other words, Frenkel pair formation in bulk tungsten in the presence of H and He atoms. Two versions of a model embedded atom interatomic potential and a bond order potential were tested by comparing it with ab initio data regarding the binding properties of pure He and He-H-Vacancy clusters and energetics of Frenkel pair formation. As a result of Molecular Dynamics simulations at finite temperature, the values of critical H concentration needed for the generation of a Frenkel pair in the presence of He clusters were obtained. The results show that the critical H concentration decreases with the size of He cluster present in the simulation cell and thus, Frenkel pair formation by H is facilitated in the presence of He clusters in the material.},

The results show that the edge dislocations are stronger traps for H and He compared to the SDs, while the H/He affinity to both types of dislocation is significantly weaker than to a single vacancy. The lowest energy atomic configurations are rationalized on the basis of the charge density distribution and elasticity theory considerations. The results obtained contribute to the rationalization of the thermal desorption spectroscopy analysis by attributing certain peaks of the release of plasma components to the detrapping from dislocations. Complementary molecular statics (MS) calculations are performed to validate the accuracy of the recently developed W–H–He embedded atom method (EAM) and bond-order potentials. It is revealed that the EAM potential can reproduce correctly the magnitude of the interaction of H with both dislocations as compared to the ab initio results. All the potentials underestimate significantly the He-dislocation interaction and cannot describe correctly the lowest energy positions for H and He around the dislocation core. The reason for the discrepancy between ab initio and the MS results is rationalized by the analysis of the fully relaxed atomic configurations.}

A recently developed interatomic potential was benchmarked using data for dislocation loops obtained earlier with two other W potentials available in literature. Molecular Static calculations demonstrated that ½〈111〉 loops feature a wide spectrum of the binding energy with a maximum value of 1.1 eV for H and 1.93 eV for He as compared to 0.89 eV and 1.56 eV for a straight ½〈111〉{110} edge dislocation. For 〈100〉 loops, the values of the binding energy were found to be 1.63 eV and 2.87 eV for H and He, respectively. These results help to better understand the role played by dislocation loops in H/He retention in tungsten. Based on the obtained results, a contribution of the considered dislocation loops to the trapping and retention under plasma exposure is discussed."

The desorption spectra in both reference and plastically-deformed samples were deconvoluted into three contributions associated with the detrapping from dislocations, deuterium-vacancy clusters and pores. As the exposure temperature increases, the positions of the release peaks in the plastically-deformed material remain in the same temperature range but the peak amplitudes are altered as compared to the reference material. The desorption peak attributed to the release from pores (i.e. cavities and bubbles) was suppressed in the plastically deformed samples for the low-temperature exposures, but became dominant for exposures above 700 K. The observed strong modulation of the deuterium storage in “shallow” and “deep” traps, as well as the reduction of the integral retention above 700 K, suggest that the dislocation network changes its role from “trapping sites” to “diffusion channels” above a certain temperature. The major experimental observations of the present work are in line with recent computational assessment based on atomistic and mean field theory calculations available in literature.}

An important safety concern in the design of plasma facing components is the retention of hydrogen isotopes. Available experimental data is vast and scattered, and a consistent physical model of retention of hydrogen isotopes in tungsten is still missing. In this work we propose a model of non-equilibrium hydrogen isotopes trapping under fusion relevant plasma exposure conditions. The model is coupled to a diffusion-trapping simulation tool and is used to interpret recent experiments involving high plasma flux exposures. From the computational analysis performed, it is concluded that high flux high temperature exposures (T = 1000 K, flux = 1024 D/m2/s and fluence of 1026 D/m2) result in generation of sub-surface damage and bulk diffusion, so that the retention is driven by both sub-surface plasma-induced defects (bubbles) and trapping at natural defects. On the basis of the non-equilibrium trapping model we have estimated the amount of H stored in the sub-surface region to be ∼10−5 at−1, while the bulk retention is about 4 × 10−7 at−1, calculated by assuming the sub-surface layer thickness of about 10 μm and adjusting the trap concentration to comply with the experimental results for the integral retention.},

Once the number of hydrogen atoms trapped on a dislocation segment exceeds eight, the emission of a jog occurs thereby converting a pure HN cluster into a HN+1-jog configuration. On the basis of these results a kinetic model was formulated to evaluate the conditions (i.e., range of temperature and flux exposure) for the transformation of pure H clusters into supercritical hydrogen–vacancy clusters attached to the dislocation line. In this work, a parametric study employing the kinetic nucleation model was performed to derive the hydrogen bubble formation energy function that offers the best agreement with available experimental results.

   abstract = {Tungsten and tungsten-based alloys are the primary candidate materials for plasma facing components in fusion reactors. The exposure to high-energy radiation, however, severely degrades the performance and lifetime limits of the in-vessel components. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms driving the materials' degradation at the atomic level, large-scale atomistic simulations are performed to complement experimental investigations. At the core of such simulations lies the interatomic potential, on which all subsequent results hinge. In this work we review 19 central force many-body potentials and benchmark their performance against experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As basic features we consider the relative lattice stability, elastic constants and point-defect properties. In addition, we also investigate extended lattice defects, namely: free surfaces, symmetric tilt grain boundaries, the 1/2〈111〉{110} and 1/2〈111〉{112} stacking fault energy profiles and the 1/2〈111〉 screw dislocation core. We also provide the Peierls stress for the 1/2〈111〉 edge and screw dislocations as well as the glide path of the latter at zero Kelvin. The presented results serve as an initial guide and reference list for both the modelling of atomically-driven phenomena in bcc tungsten, and the further development of its potentials.},

  abstract={We have developed a new theoretical model for deuterium (D) retention in tungsten-based alloys on the basis of its being trapped at dislocations and transported to the surface via the dislocation network with parameters determined by ab initio calculations. The model is used to explain experimentally observed trends of D retention under sub-threshold implantation, which does not produce stable lattice defects to act as traps for D in conventional models. Saturation of D retention with implantation dose and effects due to alloying of tungsten with, e.g. tantalum, are evaluated, and comparison of the model predictions with experimental observations under high-flux plasma implantation conditions is presented.}

   abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to study sputtering of freestanding and supported spherical Al nanoclusters with 2–10nm diameters under bombardment by Al1 and Al13 projectiles with energies of 1–13keV at normal and oblique incidence. Both monatomic and clustered yields of secondary emission are found to be larger than those for (111) flat surface of the bulk Al (at equal irradiation conditions). In some events, target nanocluster receives a backward momentum and therefore its major part (more than 1/2 of the mass) is ejected due to produced secondary emission mainly towards the substrate direction. This “recoil effect” is found more pronounced under the impact of cluster projectiles and its probability decreases with increase of the target cluster size. A restricted number of MD simulations were performed to verify whether this “recoil effect” is strong enough to desorb a 4nm Al nanocluster off an Al (111) substrate. Desorption was observed under oblique Al13 impact within the impact parameter range of 0.6–0.9.}
