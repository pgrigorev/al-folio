An article titled **"Optically Triggered NÃ©el Vector Manipulation of a Metallic Antiferromagnet Mn$$_2$$Au under Strain"** has been accepted for publication in **ACS Nano** journal and is now [avialable online](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.2c07453). My brother **Vladimir Grigorev** is the first author of this publication! The article demonstrates the manipulation of direction of the staggered magnetization of a sample using combination of strain and laser pulses. The motivation of the study is testing the capabilities of the material for future ultra fast high-density memory spintronic devices.

The experimental results are backed up by a profound theoretical analysis as well as computational modelling. The article represents an extraordinary example of successful collaboration between few teams with various backgrounds. My humble role was to perform Density Functional Theory calculations of _magneto-elastic coupling constant_ $$B_{me}$$ that shows how preferable orientation of magnetic moments of the atoms changes with applied strain.
