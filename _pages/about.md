I am a Research Fellow working in a field of computational material science. I am interested in application and development of simulation methods bringing different length and time scales. Recently I have been working on incorporating methods of reproducible research, uncertainty quantification and machine learning in mutliscale modelling approach.

Nowadays there are plenty of online resources where researchers can share information about themselves. The idea of this page is to collect information about myself in one place. You can find my publications with all the details and some pdf versions on the [publications page](/al-folio/publications/). More traditional version of my CV can be downloaded here: <a href="/assets/pdf/Grigorev_CV.pdf" target="_blank" title="download CV"> <i class="far fa-file-pdf" aria-hidden="true"></i> CV</a>. I will also do my best to post here news and updates often.
