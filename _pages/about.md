I am a Research Fellow working in the field of computational material science.
I am interested in application and development of simulation methods bridging different length and time scales.
Recently I have been working on incorporating methods of reproducible research, uncertainty quantification and machine learning in multiscale modelling approach.

###### **Short bio**

I am from Saint-Petersburg and obtained my **master degree in Physics** from [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/) in **2012**.
The same year I enrolled in a Ph.D. program shared between [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) and [Complutense University of Madrid](https://www.ucm.es/english) within the framework of [Erasmus Mundus FUSION-DC](https://web.archive.org/web/20211202151650/http://www.em-fusion-dc.org/).
However I spent most of my time at [Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK•CEN](https://www.sckcen.be/en) in Mol, Belgium working on my research project together with [Structural Materials expert group](https://www.sckcen.be/en/expertises/materials/safe-operation).

I defended my **Ph.D. in April 2017** and, shortly after that, joined [Warwick Centre for Predictive Modelling](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wcpm/) as a **Research Fellow**.
In **December 2020** I started as a **postdoc** at the [Départment Théorie et Simulation Numérique](https://www.cinam.univ-mrs.fr/cinam/team/theorie-et-simulation-numerique/) of [Centre Interdisciplinaire de Nanoscience de Marseille (CINaM)](https://www.cinam.univ-mrs.fr). I moved to [Institut Matériaux Microélectronique Nanosciences de Provence](https://www.im2np.fr/fr) for another **postdoc** in **March 2024**.
